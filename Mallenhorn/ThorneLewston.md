My friend... Hearth... I miss you...

I know we left with not much time, but I do wish we didn't leave so much behind...

I will go back for her in due time.



paladins are valued as warriors in the cult, 
your friend was about to be sacrificed for reasons u think were bs,
u used ur status as a paladin and threatened to leave if they killed him, 
you escaped with them and traveeled east, 
friend died, 
got to farwater

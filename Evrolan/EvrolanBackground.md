As a bit of background, Hazelgrove which was once, as I mentioned, a bustling hub of trade for the southwestern part of the kingdom.
At some point a couple hundred years ago, there was some kind of event, the nature of which is unknown, which was either cataclysmic, 
or scared the town's inhabitants very badly, or something along those lines - what actually happened is unknown.

Anyway, from the perspective of the capital and other major cities, Hazelgrove just took itself off the map. 
The town went from a thriving hub of trade to a town with no communication with the outside world, where people seldom visit and people seldom leave, 
	and communication with the town's authorities or mercantile entities is nigh-impossible without making the trek yourself. 
The fact that this happened so suddenly was pushed under the rug, so to speak, as the capital was worried about the prospect of invasion - even after that threat was disproven, 
	all previous attempts to reinitiate contact or discover what actually happened have been fruitless. All that is known is that something changed.

I have been sent on a mission to find out what actually happened to seemingly wipe this town off the face of the planet.
Given that whatever did happen has a large historical significance for the kingdom, since it lost one of its major trade hubs.

You seem to think you have me backed into a corner. However, I have the support and access to materials that I need to stop you if need be.
I hope that isn't necessary, as that feels like a huge missed opportunity to me. So I'd like to offer you a deal.
